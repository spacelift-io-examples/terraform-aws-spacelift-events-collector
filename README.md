# Spacelift Events Collector for AWS

Terraform module setting up a collector that receives Audit Trail events sent by Spacelift and stores them in AWS S3.

## Usage

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Change if you want to use a different region
}

module "collector" {
  source = "github.com/spacelift-io-examples/terraform-aws-spacelift-events-collector"

	# Add inputs described below as needed
}
```

## Architecture

The main resources for this module are:

- **Courier**: A Lambda function that exposes a URL (see the `courier_url` output) and forwards incoming events to a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream.
- **Stream**: A Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream that buffers events forwarded by the Courier and eventually sends them in batches to the Storage.
- **Storage**: An S3 bucket that stores the events (see the `storage_bucket_name` output).
